And for forty years, it has tortured users. To draw a curve, you click an anchor point, hold the mouse down, drag out an invisible tangent handle into empty space, release, click another point, drag another handle, and hope the resulting arc resembles what you had in your head."

        "Nobody thinks in off-curve tangent handles. When an artist sketches on paper, their pencil follows the line itself. In my software architecture, I developed two completely distinct, revolutionary ways of drawing digital curves without off-curve handle wrestling:",
        "**Method 1: Interactive On-Curve Through-Points.** In `DrawingApp/js/CurveDraw.js`, every click places an anchor strictly *on the curve itself*. Through `BezierVertex.js` and `UpdateControlPoints.js`, an 8-iteration relaxation solver evaluates the sequence of through-points and derives the exact cubic Bézier control points and $G^1$ tangencies in real time. Rather than global settings, you can target individual vertices to adjust curvature (how far control points push out) and balance (weighting between incoming and outgoing chords). For endpoints, intelligent exit vectors prevent the curve from curling back awkwardly.",
        "**Method 2: The Kinetic Tether ('String-Drag').** Pressing the `Control` key freezes the tip of the curve and lets you extend a dynamic dashed string to your mouse. Releasing `Control` pulls the curve tip forward as if towing it with an elastic rope: the longer the string, the smoother the curve, naturally dampening micro-tremors while letting you make deliberate sharp cusps by pulling at acute angles. Holding `Shift` lets you push backward along the trajectory to interactively undo glitches, re-aim the string, and pull again. When finished, our Bézier solver converts that clean physical motion into exact mathematical splines."
