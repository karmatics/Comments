  **Author & Inventor:** Rob Brown (Inventor of AccuDraw, SmartLine, US Patent #5,754,182)
  **Project Dossier:** CommentsDocs (13 Chapters • Complete Executable Living Specification)
  **System Mandate:** One Unified Tool — 100% AutoCAD Parity Baseline + AccuDraw/SmartLine Spatial Superpowers
  **Core Strategy:** AI Rebuilding and Democratizing Proven CAD Tools for Everyone

  ---

  ## 1. THE LIVING SPECIFICATION AS A TOTAL TECHNOLOGY SHOWCASE
  1. **Showcase, Don't Just Tell:** The document itself is the premier deliverable and an active gallery of our entire technological stack:
     - **Luno Workspace:** Client-side AST method patching, Outbox queuing, and local git checkpoints.
     - **Aardvark:** Universal element inspection, high-saturation electric blue recognition, and in-situ commenting.
     - **ColorPicker:** RYB hue ring and barycentric tint/shade triangle controlling live 3D PBR materials.
     - **SliderControl:** Continuous variable scrubbing with direct numerical valuation popups and MIDI-CC mapping.
     - **CurveDrawer:** On-curve G1 through-point relaxation and low-pass kinetic string dragging.
     - **AccuDraw & SmartLine:** 3D direction cosines, closest-point tangent arc swings, and universal DXF bulge factors.
  2. **Focused Sub-Application Demos (Zero Redundancy):** Instead of running the full heavy CAD suite everywhere, the document mounts lightweight, specialized views into the authentic code:
     - *Animated Compass Choreography:* Automated plane turns, squircle morphs, and axis locks using authentic AccuDraw classes.
     - *Deconstructed Squircle Lab:* Displays the radial projection lines to the 8 arc centers and tangency junction dots live from \`SquircleArc.js\`.
     - *Extensible Steampunk Cursor Demo:* A custom brass-geared reticle demonstrating that cursor HUDs are 100% pluggable without touching the kernel.
  3. **Total Control of Text & Code:** Because we control both the prose and the runtime, text is migrating from escaped JavaScript strings into clean, semantically addressable HTML templates (\`<article data-page="...">\`, \`<p data-block="...">\`).

  ---

  ## 2. RETHINKING PROMPT ENGINEERING: THE LIVING SPECIFICATION LOOP
  1. **The Application IS the Prompt:** Prompt engineering is transformed into an interactive specification-building loop.
  2. **Human-in-the-Loop Spec Drafting:** The author tours the document, uses Aardvark to attach living directives and voice notes to any DOM element, and dispatches them directly to Luno's Outbox.
  3. **AI as the Specification Architect:** The LLM refines and updates the technical specification itself, resolving mathematical edge cases and updating chapters before writing production application code.

  ---

  ## 3. INVERTED LUNO INTEGRATION & ZERO-IFRAME ARCHITECTURE
  1. **Container Inversion:** Instead of trapping CommentsDocs inside a Luno iframe, **CommentsDocs embeds Luno natively**.
  2. **In-Process Cockpit Drawer:** Tapping \`🌙 Luno\` in the header slides out the Luno control panel as an in-process drawer directly within the active window.
  3. **Zero Iframes Inside CommentsDocs:** All 3D viewports, labs, and documentation tools run natively in-process within the same DOM and WebGL memory context for peak performance and shared state.
  4. **Decoupled Mobile Companion:** The desktop workspace remains consolidated, while smartphone trackpads connect over low-latency WebRTC P2P for two-handed CAD modulation.

  ---

  ## 4. MATHEMATICAL & GEOMETRIC GROUND TRUTH
  1. **SmartLine Tangent Arcs (Closest-Point Sweep Principle):**
     - Tangent arc orientation is governed by finding the candidate circle where the cursor is as close as possible to a point on the circumference.
     - Naturally sweeps from 0° to +5° or backs up across the tangent line to -6° with zero deadband jitter.
     - Eye-perpendicular viewing angles are handled as natural degenerate projection limits.
  2. **Corner Fillets vs. Arcs:**
     - Type A: Rounded Corner Fillets calculated via closed-form O(1) 3D vector bisector math.
     - Type B: Tangent Arc Segments calculated via cursor-swing proximity, auto-orienting the compass to the exit tangent vector upon placement.
  3. **Universal Bulge Representation:**
     - All arc transitions serialize into standard DXF / CADCraft \`PolyVertex { point, bulge: tan(θ/4) }\`.
  4. **On-Curve Cubic Spline Relaxation:**
     - Proprietary 8-iteration solver (\`UpdateControlPoints.js\`) deriving exact cubic Bézier control points and continuous G1 tangencies directly through on-curve user through-points.

The AccuDraw compass sits on the Top plane basis, emitting standard 2D coordinates (`Vec2(x, y)`) directly into CADCraft commands (`LINE`, `CIRCLE`, `OFFSET`, `TRIM`). When the user engages 3D, the camera transitions to perspective orbit, the compass tilts to Front (`F`), Side (`S`), or Surface Normal (`Q`), and CADCraft's `Mat4::ocs` maps the planar polyline vertices (`PolyVertex { point, bulge }`) into 3D world space.
